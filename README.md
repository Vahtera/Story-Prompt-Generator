# Story Prompt Generator

Displays four images selected randomly from included images. To use as story prompts/ideas for TTRPGs, writing, telling stories with friends, etc, etc. My take on [Rory's Story Cubes](https://www.storycubes.com/en/) as a digital version.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Note that included images are AI-generated **PLACEHOLDER** images, until artist [Viktor Priestely](https://www.instagram.com/viktorpriestley/) is able to supply final images.

```
 * Version history:
 * Version 0.1: Initial version
 * Version 0.2: Added "rolling" animation when randomizing results.
 * Version 0.2.1: Disabled roll button while animations are running to prevent double.images.
 * Version 0.3: Added disposing of images and fixed memory leak by initiating main images list only once.
 * Revision 0.3 Version x: Added versioning from GitHub commits.
```
