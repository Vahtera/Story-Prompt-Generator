# Story Prompt Generator

Displays four images selected randomly from included images. To use as story prompts/ideas for TTRPGs, writing, telling stories with friends, etc, etc. My take on [Rory's Story Cubes](https://www.storycubes.com/en/) as a digital version.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Note that included images are AI-generated **PLACEHOLDER** images, until artist [Viktor Priestely](https://www.instagram.com/viktorpriestley/) is able to supply final images.

```

* Version 0.2.1: Disabled roll button while animations are running to prevent double.images.

* Revision 0.5: Changed Shuffle animation into a much smoother and better one.
